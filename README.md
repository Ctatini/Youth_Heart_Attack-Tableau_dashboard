# Youth Heart Attacks in India — Tableau Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
This Tableau project extends my earlier Excel analysis on **Youth Heart Attacks in India**.  
It visualizes how **lifestyle, sleep, stress, and physical activity** influence heart-attack risks in young adults.


## Dashboards Overview  

**Dashboard 1 – Lifestyle & Risk Factors**  
- Alcohol consumption by age  
- Lifestyle risk by physical activity level  
- Smoking status by age and gender  

**Dashboard 2 – Heart Attack Risk & Smoking pattern analysis**  
- Heart-attack risk by age
- Region & Area-wise smokers  

**Dashboard 3 – Lifestyle, Stress & Health Indicators**  
- Age-wise sleep patterns  
- Stress level by sleep pattern  
- Region-wise alcoholics  
- Weight based on cholesterol level  



## Key Insights  
- Heart-attack risk is rising among **youngsters**.  
- **Low Physical activity + smoking/alcohol** = higher risk.  
- **Poor sleeping hours  & stress** show clear health links.  
- **Urban regions** record higher lifestyle risks.
